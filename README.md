This is a repository made to host my exploration through the K.N. King C Programming: A Modern Approach textbook.
- CH 1 [DONE]
- CH 2 [DONE]
- CH 3 [IN-PROGRESS]
- CH 4 [NOT STARTED]

The inherent goal of this repository is to log my improvement.
I wish to obtain a good mastery of C/C++ and code a game engine in the future.
So, we will see.
